All in all, I want to be perfect. But it's impossible to be perfect in real world. So try to let them go. This isn't easy. You have to learn to adapt to this world.

The things I want:
1. A website to record all the things I've learned during these day so that I can remember them.
2. A app that I create for myself to record the money I've spent. It's related to my financial management.
3. Try to pick up the chemistry, physics and math. Devote myself into it.
